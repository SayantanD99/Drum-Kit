# Drum-Kit
This is a simple web-based drum kit application that allows users to play drum sounds by clicking on the corresponding buttons or pressing specific keys on their keyboard. The kit consists of seven buttons, each representing a different drum sound, and produces audio feedback when interacted with.

In addition to clicking on the buttons, you can also play the drum sounds using your keyboard. The keys corresponding to the drum buttons are as follows:
- "w" key: Plays the first drum sound.
- "a" key: Plays the second drum sound.
- "s" key: Plays the third drum sound.
- "d" key: Plays the fourth drum sound.
- "j" key: Plays the fifth drum sound.
- "k" key: Plays the sixth drum sound.
- "l" key: Plays the seventh drum sound.

By combining Event Listeners and DOM manipulation, the code achieves an interactive drum kit where users can click on the buttons or press specific keys to play drum sounds and see visual feedback when they interact with the buttons.

# Technologies Used
- HTML: The structure and layout of the drum kit user interface.
- CSS: Styling the elements to create an attractive and responsive design.
- JavaScript: Handling user interactions and playing the drum sounds.
